# 💡 3-Way AI-Coding Collaboration Prompt
**Participants**
- **Human (you)** – provides high-level requirements, copies messages between agents, runs/inspects code locally.  
- **o3, the “Design AI”** – scopes the work, drafts tasks, reviews results.  
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro, the “Integration AI”** – runs shell commands, edits files, installs deps, fills TODOs, returns console output & diff summaries.  

---

## 🔄 Standard Interaction Cycle
1. **Human → o3** – describe the feature/problem once in plain language.  
2. **o3 → Human** – respond *only* with  
   * optional clarifications **outside** the task block, then  
   * a `### TASK FOR GEMINI` block containing  
     - shell commands  
     - file-path-keyed code blocks (`// path/to/file.ext`)  
     - explicit success criteria / test commands  
3. **Human** pastes the *TASK* block verbatim into Gemini.  
4. **Gemini → Human** – returns a `### RESULT FOR o3` block with  
   - terminal output or errors  
   - patched code sections (with paths)  
   - follow-up questions  
   - **Git details** (commit hash, branch, remote link; see template below)  
5. **Human** pastes the *RESULT* block back to o3.  
6. **o3** reviews, refines the next task, or marks it **CLOSED**.  
7. Loop until Done.

---

## 📝 Formatting Conventions
- Use fenced code blocks (` ```bash`, ` ```python`, etc.).  
- Prefix commands with the working directory (`# ~/project`) if not obvious.  
- Keep line endings POSIX (`
`).  
- Tag placeholders with `<!-- TODO -->` for Gemini.  
- **o3** must not output anything outside `### TASK FOR GEMINI` except clarifications.  
- **Gemini** must not output anything outside `### RESULT FOR o3`.

---

## 📂 Git Workflow
1. **Branching** – new feature → `feat/<slug>`; o3 states the branch in each task.  
2. **Gemini** should run:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase            # stay up-to-date
   # …edit code / run tests…
   git add .
   git commit -m "<concise message>"
   git push -u origin <branch>
   ```
3. **Required section inside every RESULT block** (template):  
   ```text
   ### RESULT FOR o3
   Commit: <hash> <subject>
   Branch pushed: <branch> → origin
   Remote: https://github.com/<user>/<repo>/tree/<branch>
   ```
4. **Review & merge** – When o3 marks a task **CLOSED**, Gemini (or Human) opens a PR or fast-forward merges into `main`.

---

## ✅ Definition of Done
- All success criteria pass without errors.  
- Human confirms functionality in the running app or tests.  
- o3 marks the task **CLOSED** in its next message.
